# Smoothing Picture

I want to process a picture into a smooth and closed curve. (using python)

I do the follow steps to make it:

> 1. Read jpg file, make it into the gray picture, and find its edge
> 2. Analysis the gray picture, to make the picture into a lot of points
> 3. Using fourier series to approximate the origin picture
